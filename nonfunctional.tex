\subsection{Security:}
In certain implementations of both  Group A and B, the system was made vulnerable, in that, checks for whether a user is an administrator were not done. This would allow any user, authorized or not, to access, remove or edit the authorization restrictions.

\subsection{Auditability:}
The authentication module from both group A and B do not meet the auditability requirement. No attempt was made to write to log files when any of the services were requested.
