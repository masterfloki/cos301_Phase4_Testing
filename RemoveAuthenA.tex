\textbf{Authentication A Results} \newline

The removeAuthorizationRestriction function from Authentication A meets
the data structure requirements as stipulated in the requirements document.

\begin{itemize}
\item The removeAuthorizationRestriction function, however, violates the pre-condition
requirement stipulated in the service contract.

  "Pre-Condition: Has administrator role"

No checks are performed to get the role of the user performing these changes and hence
the pre-condition requirements have not been met.

\item The post-condition, as stipulated in the service contract, will only be met upon successful execution 
of the updateAuthorizationRestriction function as its the last step performed in removing an AuthorizationRestriction.

The removeAuthorizationRestriction function has a dependency on the updateAuthorizationRestriction function
and hence it's success depends on the updateAuthorizationRestricition function being in a correct working state and
meeting the requirements as stipulated in the service contract.

\item The function will have a maintainability problem because changes to the updateAuthorizationRestriction function 
might have an adverse effect on the correct performance of this function.
\end{itemize}
