1) Functional Testing:
======
#addAuthorizationRestrictions: (addAuthorization)

The domain model for buzzAuthorization specifies that a restriction is made 
for a particular user role on a specific buzz space.
This is not the case in Authentication B's addAuthorizationRestrictions, 
a Restriction is instead added to a specific service on a buzzSpace with a
role and minimum status points.

Even though this works just fine it is not according to the master 
specification.

the Restriction constists of a buzzSpace,role,serviceID and 
minimumStatusPoints which adheres to the specification.
======

======
Pre-conditions:
*User adding the restriction has admin rights - This was not met in
this service, because the service doesn't test for the condition at all.
*The restriction does not yet exist - this pre-condition is met in the service
it tests if the restriction exists and if so an appropriate exception is thrown,
if not then the restriction specified is added/persisted to the database after a few 
conditions are met.
======

======
Post-conditions:
*The restriction persisted, this condition is met when all the pre-conditions in 
the service are met (those specified in the master spec and those that are not),
then the restriction is persisted to the database.
