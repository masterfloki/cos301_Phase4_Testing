\textbf{A Summary Comparison of the two Authentication Modules:}\newline
Looking at the implementation of the two Authentication modules, one can see the great thought put into implementing the use cases; however, the implementations from both sides did not entirely conform to the specified requirements.

\begin{itemize}
\item With regard to Group A's implementation, there was a general lack of meeting the contract requirements, as majority of the pre-conditions are not checked for. However, the post-conditions are met as well as the data structure requirements.

\item More than half of the test cases here were passed. \newline

\item In Group B's implementation, the contract requirements were largely violated, as in many cases both the pre-conditions and post-conditions were not met, particularly, the post-conditions. 

\item Less than half of the test cases here were passed and in one of the use cases, it was seemingly impossible to test as the implementation largely did not conform to the requirements. \newline

\item With reference to the quality requirements, both modules performed the same, in the sense that if one module did not meet a quality requirement, the same went for the other.
\end{itemize}
