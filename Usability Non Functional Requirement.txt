Usability 

The Authorization module meets the usability requirement because it consists
of methods that are easy to use in any part of the buzz system.
The "require" feature of nodeJS allows for effortless inclusion of the Authorization 
module, again this allows for easy integration with other modules.
The parameters of the methods in Authentication B are simple and straightforward and thus
quickly understood and implemented. The same applies to the methods in Authentication A, 
which only takes in RestrictionRequests as parameters, this prevents confusion and potential
errors due to mixed up parameters. 
The users of the buzz space don't come face to face with the backend of Authentication and as 
such are not considered in the usability of this module. However, the methods in this module
(Athentication A and B) do return clear and comprehensive results such as objects and exceptions. 
These results are in turn handled by other modules that interact with the users, so Authorization 
is indirectly quite usable to the extent that it can perform optimally through other modules.
The pre-conditions and post-conditions in both Authentication A and B ensure that the use of this 
module is done in a restricted manner so as to guide the user (admin) of this module, this again
makes it easy and simple to use.
